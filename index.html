          <h2>4. Future Monetization: Advertising and Subscriptions</h2>
          <p class="text-muted">
            Our App is currently free to use. However, we are planning to
            introduce monetization features in the future. This section outlines
            how your data may be used in relation to these features.
          </p>
          <div class="future-monetization-box">
            <h3>a. Advertising</h3>
            <p>
              We may partner with third-party advertising networks (such as
              Google AdMob) to display advertising within the App. These
              companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to
              collect information about your device and your use of the App to
              serve you with relevant ads. This information is used to deliver
              targeted advertising and to measure ad performance. We will not
              share any personally identifiable information with our ad partners
              without your consent.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="future-monetization-box">
            <h3>b. Subscriptions</h3>
            <p>
              If we introduce subscription-based premium features, we will use a
              third-party payment processor (such as Google Play In-App Billing)
              to handle transactions. We will not collect or store your payment
              card details. That information is provided directly to our
              third-party payment processors whose use of your personal
              information is governed by their Privacy Policy.
